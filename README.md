# ENED1120_Robot
Python based programming for EV3 based on UC's parameters to program an autonomous robot that could read a barcode, pick up items, navigate, and other such similar tasks

Majority of this robot project is tailiored to our inital device that used two large motors, one medium, a gyrosensor, color sensor and was quite small--although the code works it does not work in a continuios loop
